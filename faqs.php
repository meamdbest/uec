			<article>
				<h3>Whats it all about?</h3>
				<p>The day is about having fun! And I think for most people there will be an element of winning involved!</p>
			</article>
        	<article>
				<h3>How many people can I have in my team?</h3>
				<p>The maximum number of people in a team is 5.</p>
			</article>
        	<article>
				<h3>Can we use more than 1 car per team?</h3>

				<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
				<p>The cost for this year’s challenge will be &pound;20.00 per person if paid in advance. For teams who do not pay until the day the cost will be &pound;25.00 per person.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>Why does it cost this much – last year was cheaper?</h3>
				<p>Last year was our pilot year – this year we have bigger and better prizes, more has been added throughout the day and in particular for the evening entertainment/refreshments. We really feel that &pound;20.00 for a whole day’s entertainment is a reasonable cost. All of the money gets used on the day we do not get any money back for expenses! So please rest assured we are not making a profit of any kind!.</p>

				<h3>What if the weather is bad?</h3>
